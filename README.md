Repository for Python codes to calculate the impact of cyclone clustering for extremely high sea levels in the Baltic Sea. These codes are used to produce the results and figures in the upcoming GRL paper "The impact of serial cyclone clustering on extremely high sea levels in the Baltic Sea".

To start, run calculate_clustering_statistics.py and calculate_sea_level_statistics.py. These scripts calculate the main results and save them to the disk as csv-files. 

The figures of the GRL paper can be reproduced by running the respective plotting scripts.
